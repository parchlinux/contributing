# Getting Involved with Parch GNU/Linux

Parch GNU/Linux is a community-driven distribution, and we greatly value the participation and contributions of our users. By getting involved, you can not only benefit the Parch project, but also improve the overall free and open-source software ecosystem.

This guide outlines various ways Parch users can contribute to the community. Before getting started, please familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct].

- Join us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/%23parchlinux:matrix.org) to chat with fellow Parch users and developers in real-time.

### Improve the Documentation
- The [Parch Wiki](https://wiki.parchlinux.com) is our centralized documentation hub, and we encourage all users to help expand and maintain it.
- Correct any errors, add new articles, and ensure existing content is up-to-date.

- Try out new packages and provide feedback to the Parch Testing Team.

### Request Features

- Be sure to follow the guidelines to ensure your request is valid and well-documented.

## Become a Parch Developer
While new developers are typically invited by the existing team, you can increase your chances by:
- Establishing a reputation as a helpful and knowledgeable community member
- Contributing to the Parch Wiki, reporting and fixing bugs, and maintaining PCP packages
- Submitting patches to Parch software projects and participating in their development

Remember, the primary motivation for contributing to Parch should be to support the entire community, not just to become a developer. By actively participating and demonstrating your skills, you can earn the trust and recognition of the Parch team over time.
